# Pokémon Type Calculator – Quickmode

This project is a fast, responsive Pokémon type calculator built for real-time use during gameplay — especially for [Pokerogue.net](https://pokerogue.net) and similar games.

## Features
- 🔍 Pokédex search with autocomplete (Gen 1–9)
- 🖱 Type button selection (manual input)
- ⚔️ Attacker/Defender mode toggle
- 🎮 Pixel ↔ Full Art sprite toggle
- 🌙 Dark mode
- 💡 Transparent, HUD-style design ideal for side-by-side use

## Why I Built This
I created this project to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub Pages. It started as a simple type calculator and evolved into a full tool that helped me better understand:

- DOM manipulation
- Data-driven UI (from JSON)
- User experience design
- Hosting and version control via GitHub
