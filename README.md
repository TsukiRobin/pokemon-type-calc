# Pokémon Type Calculator

This is a custom-built, browser-based type effectiveness calculator I created to assist during battles in [Pokerogue](https://pokerogue.net) and other Pokémon-style games.

### Features
- ✅ Autocomplete Pokédex search (Gen 1–9)
- ✅ Type auto-detection from selected Pokémon
- ✅ Sprite toggle (Pixel ↔ Full Art)
- ✅ Dark mode toggle for late-night battles
- ✅ Fast, responsive layout ideal for side-by-side gaming

### Why I Built It
I started this project to learn how to:
- Use HTML, CSS and JavaScript together in a functional app
- Work with dynamic JSON data (like Pokédex info)
- Build responsive, useful UIs from scratch
- Host my own tools with GitHub Pages

This has been a fun way to dive into front-end dev
